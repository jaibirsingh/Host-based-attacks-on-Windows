* Well-known instances where Windows Vulnerabilities were exploited are MS08-067 (Conflicker) and MS17-010(EteranlBlue)
* Most of these vulnerabilities have publicly accessible exploit code.

* Windows OS has been devloped in the C programming language --> making them vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, etc.
* Windows is not configured to run securely and requires an proactive implementationn of security practices.
* Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not immediately patched by Microsoft and given the fragmented nature of Windows, many systems are left unpatched.
* Windows ia also vulnerable to cross-platform vulnerabilities, for example SQL injection attacks, cross-side scripting.
* Physical attacks: Theft, Malicious peripheral devices, wtc.

# Types of Windows Vulnerabilities
* **Information disclosures**
  * Vulnerability that allows an attacker to access confidential data.
 
* **Buffer Overflows**
  * Caused by a programming error, allows attacker to write data to a buffer and overrun the allocate dbuffer, consequently writing data to allocated memory addresses.
 
* **Remote Code Execution**
  * To remotely execute code on the target system
 
* **Privilege Escalation**
  * To elevate their privileges afte rinitial compromise
 
* **Denial of Service (DOS)**
  * To consume a system/host's resources (CPU, RAM, Network, etc.) consequently preventing system from functioniung normally.
