* Elevating privileges to a user with administrative or root access on a system.

# What is a Kernel
* A computer program that is the core of an operating system.
* Acts as a translation between hardware and software and facilitates the communication between these two layers.
* **Windows NT**: A kernel that comes pre-packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows.
    * Consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to system resources resources and hardware:
        * User Mode: Programs and services running in  user mode have limited access to system resources and functionality
        * Kernel Mode: Unrestricted access to system resources.
     
* Exploiting the kernel will differ based on the version of Windows

* ** Methodology for privilege escalation**
    * Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
    * Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits on to the target system.
 
* **TOOLS**
    1. Windows-Exploit-Suggester
        * Compares a target patch levels against the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target.
        * Also notifies if there are any public exploits and Metasploit modules available.
        * https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester
      
    2. Windows-Kernel-Exploits
       * Collection of Windows kernel exploits sorted by CVE.
       * https:github.som/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS16-135
