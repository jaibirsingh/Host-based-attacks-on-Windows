# Alternate Data Streams
* It is an NTFS (New Technology File System) file attribute and was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS (Hierarchical File System).
* Any file created on an NTFS fomratted drive will have two different forks/streams:
  * Data stream - Default stream that contains the data of the file.
  * Resource stream - Typically contains the metadata of the file.
* **How attackers can use ADS**
  * Used to hide malicious code or executables in legitimate files.
  * Done by storing the malicious code or executables in the file attribute resource stream (metadata) of a legitimate file.
 
* **Where is ADS typically useful**
  * Used to evade basic signature based AVs and static scanning tools.
 
* PRACTICAL
  * `type payload.exe > visible.txt:hidden.exe`
  * `start visible.txt:hidden.exe` --> If this doesn't work, create a symbolic link as follows:
  * `mklink hiddenLink.exe [absolute path of hidden.exe. Eg- C:\Temp\visible.txt:hidden.exe]` --> Do this with administrator privileges
  * `hiddenLink.exe` --> It will start executing the payload.exe. Where payload.exe could be a payload generated with msfvenom or some other way.
