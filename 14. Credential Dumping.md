**What is Hashing**
* The process of converting a piece of data into another value.
* **HOW** --> A hashing function or algortihm is used to generate the new value

**Where Windows Password hashes are stored**
* Windows OS stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database.

* Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the Local Security Authority (LSA)  --> this ties to the lsass.exe process
* Windows versions up to Windows Server 2003 utilizes 2 types of hashes:
  * LM
  * NTLM
* But from Windows Vista onwards, Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes the NTLM hashing.


## SAM database
**WHAT** --> A databse file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on Windows.
* All user account apsswords stored in the SAM db are hashed.
* The SAM DB file cannot be copied while the OS is running.
* **How can be exploited**
  * The windows NT kernel keeps the SAM DB file locked and as a result, attackers typically utilize in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
  * Elevated/ Administrative privileges are required to access and interact with the LSASS process.
 
* In modern versions of Windows, the SAM DB is encrypted with a syskey.

## LM (LanMan) hash
* The default hashing algorithm in Windows OS prior to NT4.0
* **PROCESS** -->
  * The password is broken into two seven-character chunks
  * All characters are then converted into uppercase
  * Each chunk is then hashed separately with the DES algorithm.
  * Password123 --> 2-chunks --> PASSWO and RD123 --> DES (Hashing algo) --> Hash1+Hash2 (LM Hash) 
* **WHY LM IS WEAK**  
  * It can easily be cracked because the password hash does not include salts --> making brute force and rainbow table attacks effective gaainst LM hashes.
 
## NTLM (NTHash)
* A collection of authentication protocols that are utilized in Windows to facilitate authentication between computers.The authentication process involves using a valid username and password.
* From Windows vista onwards --> LM disabled and utlized NTLM.
* **HOW IT IS BETTER THAN LM**
  * Does not split the hash into two chunks
  * Case sensitive
  * Allows the use of symbols and unicode characters.
 
* **PROCESS**
  * pass!w0rd123! --> MD4 (Hashing algo) --> Hash (NTLM Hash)
