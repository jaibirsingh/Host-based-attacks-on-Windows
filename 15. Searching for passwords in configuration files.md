* Passwords can be stored in configuration files of third-party applications and Windows, but Windows configuration files will only be discussed as part of this course.

## How Windows Configuration Files work
* Windows can automate a variety of repetitve tasks --> such as the mass rollout or installation of Windows on many systems.
* This is done through the use of the Unattended Windows Setup utility --> used to automate the mass installation/deployment of Windows on multiple systems.
* **How this utility works** --> Use configuration files containing specific configurations and user credentials, specifically the Administrator account's password.'
* **What could be the flaw** --> If the Unattended Windows Setup configuration files are left on the target system after installation  --> they can reveal user account credentials that can be used by attackers to authenticate legitimately.
* **Files containing user account and system configuration information** : (Typically under these paths)
  * C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
  * C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
 
* **General security precaution** --> The password stored in the Unattended Windows Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64.

* PRACTICAL
