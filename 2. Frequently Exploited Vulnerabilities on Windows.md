*  **The tutorial focusses on the services and protocols native to the Windows system rather than using the third-party applications for exploitation**

* Microsoft Windows has various native services and protocols that can be configured to run on a host.
* These services provide an attacker with an access vector that they cna utilize to gain access to a target host.
* So as a pentester, I need to have good understanding of what these services are, how they work and their potential vulnerabilities.
