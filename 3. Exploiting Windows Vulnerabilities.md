# Exploiting Microsoft IIS and WebDAV

## What is IIS
* Proprietary extensible web server software developed by Microsoft for use with thw Windows NT family.
* Used to host websites as it provides administrators with a robust GUI for managing websites.
* Used to host both static and dynamic web pages developed in ASP.NET and PHP.
* Typically configured to run ports 80 (without SSL) /443 (With SSL).
* Supportable file extensions:
  * .asp
  * .aspx
  * .config
  * .php
 
## What is WebDAV (Web-based Distriobuted Authoring and Versioning)
* A set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.
* It enables a web server (like IIS) to function as a file server for collaborative authoring.
* It can run on top of Apache server or Microsoft IIS on ports 80 (without SSL) and 443 (in case if SSL is configured)
* **How to connect to a WebDAV server**
 * I need to provide legitimate credentials.
 * I can connect to a WebDAV server by accessing the Microsoft IIS through a web browser, and specifying the WebDAV as the folder as specified in the lab work.

## WebDAV exploitation
* First step: Identifying whether WebDAV has been configured to run on the IIS web server/ Apache --> ties to the Enumeration part.
* Then we can perform a brute force attack on the WebDAV server --> To identify legitimate credentials that can be used for authentication (If authentication nopt configured, then access is relatively easier).
* Then authenticate with the WebDAV server --> Upload a malicious .asp payload --> Used to execute arbitrary commands or obtain a reverse shell on the target
