# SMB (Server Message Block)
* It is a network file sharing protocol--> used to facilitate sharing of files and peripherals (printers and serial ports) between computers on a local network (LAN).
* SMB uses port 445 on TCP. Originally SMB ran on top of NETBIOS using port 139.
* Authentication might be configured.
* **SAMBA** is the open source Linux implementation of SMB, and allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.
* Windows --> SMB  ~~~  Linux --> Samba

## SMB Authentication
 1. User AUthentication
 2. Share Authentication

### 1. User AUthentication
* A usernmae and password is required to access a share.

### 2. Share Authentication
* Just a password is required to access share.


**Both of these authentication levels utilize a CHALLENGE RESPONSE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM.**

## How SMB Authentication works
* Client ---> Authentication Request
* Server ---> Encrypted string with User's hash
* Client ---> Encrypted string
* Server ---> Hash compared and access grant decided

# PsExec
* It is a lightweight telnet replacement developed by Microsoft.
* **USE**:
    * Allows to execute processes on remtoe windows system suing any user's credentials.
    * PsExec utility is used to authenticate with the target system legitimately and run arbitrary commands or launch a remote command prompt
* PsExec authentication is performed via SMB.
* PsExec is similar to RDP but instead of controlling the remote system via GUI, commands are sent through CMD.
