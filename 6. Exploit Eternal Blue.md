# What is Eternal Blue
* It is the name given to a collection of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
* Allegedly developed by NSA to take advantage of the MS17-010 vulnerability ---> Leaked by a hacker group called the Shadow Brokers in 2017.

# How does it work?
* It takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol  --> Allowed attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.
* I don't need to perform privilege escalation after exploiting this vulnerability as an escalated privilege is granted.
*  Eternal Blue exploit has a MSF auxiliary module ---> Check if thetarget system is vulnerable  --> Also has an exploit module to be used on unpatches systems.
*  Using this module, a meterpreter session with a privileged access is granted on the target system.
*  In addition to the MSF modules, there are also publically available exploit codes which can be used. Manual process is not documented here, but can be researched.

*  **EXPLOIT with msfconsole**
      * `search eternalblue`
      * `use windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
      * `set rhosts [IP]`
      *  `exploit` ---> This should provide a meterpreter session.
